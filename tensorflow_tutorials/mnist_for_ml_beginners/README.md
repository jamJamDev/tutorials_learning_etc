Getting Started With TensorFlow Tutorial
========================================

Moved onto the first tutorial from tensorflow's website, [MNIST for ML for Beginners](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners).

Notes
--------
<b>4/30/2017:</b> getting "MemoryError" "Process finished with exit code 1". Will be looking into more soon. May need to adjust something in my VM settings?
