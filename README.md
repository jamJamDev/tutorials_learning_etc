Tutorials, Learning, etc.
---------------------

This repository is used for any sort of learning, classes, tutorials, etc. I'm going through.
I don't claim this work as my own but it's just some things I'm working on. 
I will do my best to create a README in each project folder that will have links to resources I used.
